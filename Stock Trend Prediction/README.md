This paper proposes an adaptive prediction framework using an ensemble of machine learning models to predict the direction of the closing price, which is shown in the Figure Below.  First, the Moving average and Exponential Moving average is calculated in the Stock data set. Then, all featured data is passed as input to multiple machine learning models and the method with the highest prediction accuracy is recorded. Finally, the data is passed through an Ensemble model that aggregate the predictions of the individual models and verifies the prediction accuracy of each pattern by processing the data.
